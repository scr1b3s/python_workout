# What this repo's about?
The Python Workout is book from Manning Publications where the author, Reuven M. Lerner, a enterprise teacher, proposes and develops Python Exercises to consolidate native concepts of the language.

# How's this repository going to be organized:
I use a lot of Astral's tools, such as `uv` and `ruff`... So this repository's going to use uv to package and version control and ruff for formating, the exercises are going to be reflected upon in `.md` files in the root of the directory.

So, for example: There's a chapter about _Numeric Types_, `numeric_types` will be a directory where the exercises will be located in the root, or in folders themselves, and the reflection will be made in `.md` files... It's pretty simple, really.
